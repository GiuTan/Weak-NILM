# Weak-NILM
This repository contains source code to perform multi-label classification using a deep learning approach trained with weakly labeled data. 
The implemented network is a CRNN, for which the architecture refers to [].
Both strongly and weakly labeled data can be generated from two real-world benchmark datasets (REFIT and UK-DALE).
