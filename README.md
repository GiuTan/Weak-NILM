# Weak-NILM
This repository contains source code to perform multi-label classification using a deep learning approach trained with weakly labeled data. 
The implemented network is a CRNN, for which the architecture refers to [].
Both strongly and weakly labeled data can be generated from two real-world benchmark datasets (REFIT and UK-DALE).

Two experiments are proposed:
- one related to UK-DALE where it is possible to vary the percentage of bags with strong annotations as well as weak annotations
- one related to mixed dataset where the network can be trained with a percentage of strong annotations from UK-DALE and a quantity of weak annotations from REFIT, testing on both dataset the performance of the network.
